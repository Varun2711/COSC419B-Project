# Group meeting 8

## March 3, 2025

### Progress:

- Corrected our assumptions on the legibility classifier.
- Decided to keep the legibility classifier, and look for ways to optimize it
- A set of intermediate and output data is created for each step of the pipeline, for further analysis on individual components.

### Next week goals:

- Add code from the `jersey-number-pipeline` repository to our repository, which will serve as a base for our pipeline
